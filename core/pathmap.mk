# A central place to define mappings to paths, to avoid hard-coding
# them in Android.mk files. Not meant for header file include directories,
# despite the fact that it was historically used for that!
#
# If you want this for a library's header files, use LOCAL_EXPORT_C_INCLUDES
# instead. Then users of the library don't have to do anything --- they'll
# have the correct header files added to their include path automatically.
#

#
# TODO: Allow each project to define stuff like this before the per-module
#       Android.mk files are included, so we don't need to have a big central
#       list.

# A mapping from shorthand names to include directories.
